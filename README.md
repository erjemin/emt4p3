# mdash Typograph for Python 3.5 (and above)

It is EMT (Evgeny Muravjev Typograph) prepared for Python 3.5 (and above). Original EMT is written in PHP and can be found here: [github.com/emuravjev/mdash](https://github.com/emuravjev/mdash) and
[mdash.ru](http://mdash.ru).

----
### Note

Be aware that when combined with wysiwyg-editor (like ckeditor), EMT can create HTML-code artifacts and even cause typographer to crash. Be careful and get ready to add pre- and post-processing crutches.

### TODO

* Protect text in `<pre>`, `<code>`, `<kbd>`, `<script>` and `<style>` tags.
* Long word wrap (Hyphenation `&shy;`).
